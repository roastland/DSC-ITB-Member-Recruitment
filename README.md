Flutter is Google’s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter can save time and effort by requiring only one codebase to develop applications on multiple platforms, instead of having to spend time creating separate codebases for each platform.

➕
- Fast development, Flutter's hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster.
- Expressive and flexible UI, layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering and expressive and flexible designs.
- Native performance, Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.

➖
- Flutter community is just growing, if you want to find resources or ask questions, it's still difficult.
- The plugins are still a lot of bugs, sometimes it's a little tricky to solve the problem.
